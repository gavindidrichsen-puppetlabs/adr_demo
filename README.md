# Architectural Design Decisions (ADR)

The following is [Andy Dote's](https://andydote.co.uk/2019/06/29/architecture-decision-records/) summary of Architectural Design Decisions:

> Architecture Design Records are there to solve the main question people repeatedly ask when they view a new codebase or look at an older part of their current codebase:
>
> > Why on earth was it done like this?!
>
> Generally speaking, architectural decisions have been made in good faith at the time, but as time marches on, things change, and the reasoning gets lost. The reasoning might be discoverable through the commit history, or some comments in a type somewhere, and every once in a while, people remember the Wiki exists, and hope that someone else remembered and put some docs there. They didnâ€™t by the way.
>
> Architecture Design Records are aiming to solve all of this, with three straightforward attributes: **Easy to Write**, **Easy to Read**, and **Easy to Find**.

## Setup

Before getting started make sure the following utilities are present:

* [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
* [adr-log](https://github.com/adr/adr-log)

## Usage

### (1) Initialize your repository to use ADR

```bash
# cd into your repo root

# if not done already, then initialize the ADR document directory
adr init
```

### (2) Create a new decision

```bash
# create a new design decision, e.g., `adr new "Title of your design decision"`
adr new "Do whiteboard wednesday talks" 

# fill in the "Context", "Decision", and "Consequences" of the new doc
vim doc/adr/0002-do-whiteboard-wednesday-talks.md
```

### (3) Add a 'table of contents' for your design decisions to your root-level README

The following are sample ADR decisions for reference:

<!-- adrlog -->

* [ADR-0001](doc/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) - Record architecture decisions
* [ADR-0002](doc/adr/0002-dry-up-duplicated-code-in-github-actions.md) - Dry up duplicated code in github actions

<!-- adrlogstop -->

View the raw markdown to see the `adrlog` and `adrlogstop` tags.  The above list of sample ADR's was generated by the next step, which populates a list of all ADR's between the `adrlog` and `adrlogstop` tags.

### (4) Update the decision 'table of contents'

After adding new design decision records, then remember to update the table of contents in the root-level README:

```bash
# update the `README.md` table of contents to include the newest design decision
adr-log -i README.md -d doc
```
