# 2. Do whiteboard wednesday talks

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Knowledge is spread around the team and usually stays there hidden or siloed.  For example, many teams do both unit and acceptance testing.  In many cases, the testing strategies can be very different.  Is there any room for re-use?  How do we encourage sharing of knowledge like this?

Documentation is one way to share information, but sometimes if this is present it can remain "hidden".  One way for us to have regular informal talks where people share tech or techniques that they use and find helpful

## Decision

We will do Whiteboard Wednesday's and encourage people to share.

## Consequences

Hidden knowledge will--hopefully-be shared!
